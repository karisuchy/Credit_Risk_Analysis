# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I used supervised machine learning to predict credit risk. Using Python and the Scikit-learn library, I built and evaluated several machine learning models using different algorithms. The goal is to help lending institutions find the right balance of choosing the good credit risks so they can earn revenue by collecting interest while minimizing the risk that borrowers will defulat on their loans which causes lenders to lose money. 

## Results

The first machine learning models that I used were RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms which oversample data. Next, I  undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids model. I then used combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN model. Finally, I used two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 


There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)
